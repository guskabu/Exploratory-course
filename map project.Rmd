##Interactive Map Assignment: Developing Data Products
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

##Submission:

By accessing the Open Data NYC api we can look at art museum locations in New York City.
```{r}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=36.830995, lng= -2.456830, popup="My house :D")
my_map
```
